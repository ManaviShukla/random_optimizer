Project: An Analysis of Optimization Strategies in Machine Learning
This README provides instructions on how to retrieve the code, data, and dependencies, and how to run the code for Assignment 2


1. Retrieving the Code
GitHub Repository:
Clone the repository using the following command:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ManaviShukla/random_optimizer.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the repository from the GitHub page and extract it to your desired directory.
2. Retrieving the Data

Data Sources:
Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset: It is being extracted in the code itself using ucimlrepo module

3. Installing Dependencies
Using requirements.txt:

Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd your-repository
Install the required libraries using pip:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

If mlrose installation still doesn't work for you, use the following commands-

>pip install mlrose_hiive@git+https://github.com/hiive/mlrose/

>pip install joblib==1.0.0

4. Running the Code
Jupyter Notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook:
sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the run_model.ipynb file from the Jupyter interface.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
